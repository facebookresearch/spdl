  # We define a local mypy checker here rather than using https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
  # so it can run within the project's uv environment & access the correct installed libraries. See:
  # https://whynothugo.nl/journal/2023/01/12/notes-on-pre-commit/#using-the-system-plugin-language
  # Further, this check is set to never fail, but will print all current mypy failures. See:
