Performance Analysis
====================

When optimizing ML model pipeline, it is important to determine if data loading is bottleneck.
SPDL facilitates the pipeline performance analysis.

:py:class:`Pipeline` records runtime statistics and report them at the end of the execution.
In this section, we look at how to analyze the pipeline performance and optimize the pipeline.
