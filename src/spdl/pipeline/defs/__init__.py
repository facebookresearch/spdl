"""This module provides building block definitions for :py:class:`~spdl.pipeline.Pipeline`.

You can build a pipeline by creating a :py:class:`PipelineConfig`,
then passing it to :py:func:`spdl.pipeline.build_pipeline` function.

The following step explains the steps to build a pipeline using the building blocks.

- Instantiate a :py:class:`SourceConfig` by providing a ``Iterable`` or
  ``AsyncIterable``.
- Using :py:func:`Pipe`, :py:func:`Aggregate` or :py:func:`Disaggregate`,
  instantiate a series of :py:class:`PipeConfig`.
- Instantiate a :py:class:`SinkConfig`.
- Pass the config objects created in the previous steps to :py:class:`PipelineConfig`.
- Pass the ``PipelineConfig`` object to :py:func:`spdl.pipeline.build_pipeline` function.
