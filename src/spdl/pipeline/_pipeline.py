    """Pipeline()

    Data processing pipeline. Use :py:class:`PipelineBuilder` to instantiate.

    ``Pipeline`` and ``PipelineBuilder`` facilitate building data processing pipeline
    consists of multiple stages of async operations.
    It allows to configure the concurrency of each stage independently.

    Typically, the source is a lightweight (synchronous) iterable that generates the
    source location of data, such as file paths and URLs.
    The first stage retrieves  data from the (network) storage.

    The subsequent stages process the data, such as decoding images and resizing them,
    or decoding audio and resampling them.

    After the preprocessings are done, the data are buffered in a sink, which is a queue.

    The pipeline is executed in a background thread, so that the main thread can perform
    other tasks while the data are being processed.

    The following diagram illustrates this.
