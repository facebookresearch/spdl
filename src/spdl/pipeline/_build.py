# The following is how we intend pipeline to behave. If the implementation
# is inconsistent with the following, it is a bug.
#
# 1. Successful execution.
#
#    Assumption: The consumer keeps consuming the data from the output queue.
#
#    Each stage completes without failure.
#    The source will pass EOF, and each stage receiving EOF will shut down,
#    then pass EOF.
#    EOF is not propagated to the output queue.
#
# 2. Failures at some stage. One or more stages fail.
#
#    Assumption: The consumer keeps consuming the data from the output queue.
#
#    Resolution:
#      We want to keep the tasks downstream to failed ones alive, so that they
#      can finish the ongoing works.
#
#    Actions:
#      - The stage must pass EOF to the next queue, so that downstream stages
#        can exit cleanly.
#      - Passing EOF to the next queue can be blocked if the queue is full.
#      - For a graceful exit, the assumption must be met.
#      - The stages upstream to the failure must be cancelled.
#
# 3. Cancelled: The pipeline execution is cancelled.
#
#    Assumption: The consumer stopped consuming the data from the output queue.
#
#    Actions:
#      - All the stages must be cancelled.
#        (If tasks are blocked on async await, cancelling should do).
#
# Following the above intention, each stage must pass EOF to the output queue
# unless the task was cancelled. See `_queue_stage_hook`.
