# The following is how we intend pipeline to behave. If the implementation
# is inconsistent with the following, it is a bug.
#
# 1. Successful execution.
#
#    Assumption: The consumer keeps consuming the data from the output queue.
#
#    Each stage completes without failure.
#    The source will pass EOF, and each stage receiving EOF will shut down,
#    then pass EOF.
#    EOF is not propagated to the output queue.
#    (It is sink's responsibility to filter out EOF.)
#
# 2. Failures at some stage. One or more stages fail.
#
#    Assumption: The consumer keeps consuming the data from the output queue.
#
#    Resolution:
#      We want to keep the tasks downstream to failed ones alive, so that they
#      can finish the ongoing works.
#
#    Actions:
#      - The failed stage must pass EOF to the next queue, so that
#        the downstream stages can exit cleanly.
#      - Passing EOF to the next queue can be blocked if the queue is full.
#      - For a graceful exit, the assumption of the continued consumption must be met.
#      - The stages upstream to the failure must be cancelled.
#
# 3. Cancelled: The pipeline execution is cancelled.
#
#    Assumption: The consumer stopped consuming the data from the output queue.
#
#    Actions:
#      - All the stages must be cancelled.
#        (If tasks are blocked on async await, cancelling should do).
#
# Following the above intention, each stage must pass EOF to the output queue
# unless the task was cancelled. See `_queue_stage_hook`.

    Args:
        pipeline_cfg: The definition of the pipeline to build.

        num_threads: The number of threads in the thread pool commonly used among
            Pipeline stages.

            .. note::

               If a stage in the pipeline has dedicated executor, that stage will
               use it.

        max_failures: The maximum number of failures each pipe stage can have before
            the pipeline is halted. Setting ``-1`` (default) disables it.

        report_stats_interval: When provided, report the pipeline performance stats
            every given interval. Unit: [sec]

            This is only effective if there is no custom hook or custom AsyncQueue
            provided for stages. The argument is passed to
            :py:class:`TaskStatsHook` and :py:class:`StatsQueue`.

            If a custom stage hook is provided and stats report is needed,
            you can instantiate :py:class:`TaskStatsHook` and include
            it in the hooks provided to :py:meth:`PipelineBuilder.pipe`.

            Similarly if you are providing a custom :py:class:`AsyncQueue` class,
            you need to implement the same logic by your self.

        queue_class: If provided, override the queue class used to connect stages.
            Must be a class (not an instance) inherits :py:class:`AsyncQueue`.

        task_hook_factory: If provided, used to create task hook objects, given a
            name of the stage. If ``None``, a default hook,
            :py:class:`TaskStatsHook` is used.
            To disable hooks, provide a function that returns an empty list.

        stage_id: The index of the initial stage  used for logging.
