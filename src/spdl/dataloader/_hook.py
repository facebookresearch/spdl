class PipelineHook(ABC):
    """Base class for hooks to be used in the pipeline.

    ``PipelineHook`` can add custom actions when executing pipeline.
    It is useful for logging and profiling the pipeline execution.

    A hook consists of two async context managers. ``stage_hook`` and ``task_hook``.

    ``stage_hook`` is executed once when the pipeline is initialized and finalized.
    ``task_hook`` is executed for each task.

    The following diagram illustrates this.

    .. mermaid::

       flowchart TD
           subgraph TaskGroup[Tasks ]
               subgraph Task1[Task 1]
                   direction TB
                   s1["__aenter__() from task_hook()"] --> task1["task()"]
                   task1 --> e1["__aexit__() from task_hook()"]
                   e1 -.-> |"If task() succeeded, \\nand __aexit__() did not fail"| q1["Result Queued"]
               end
               subgraph ...
                   direction TB
                   foo[...]
               end
               subgraph TaskN[Task N]
                   direction TB
                   sN["__aenter__() from task_hook()"] --> taskN["task()"]
                   taskN --> eN["__aexit__() from task_hook()"]
                   eN -.-> |"If task() succeeded, \\nand __aexit__() did not fail"| qN["Result Queued"]
               end
           end
           StageStart["__aenter__() from stage_hook()"] --> TaskGroup
           TaskGroup --> StageComplete["__aexit__() from stage_hook()"]

    To add custom hook, subclass this class and override ``task_hook`` and
    optionally ``stage_hook`` method, and pass an instance to methods such as
    :py::meth:`spdl.dataloader.AsyncPipeline.pipe`.

    .. tip::

       When implementing a hook, you can decide how to react to task/stage failure, by
       choosing the location of specific logics.

       See :py:obj:`contextlib.contextmanager` for detail, and
       :py:class:`spdl.dataloader.TaskStatsHook` for an example implementation.

       .. code-block:: python

          @asynccontextmanager
          async def stage_hook(self):
              # Add initialization logic here
              ...

              try:
                  yield
                  # Add logic that should be executed only when stage succeeds
                  ...
              except Exception as e:
                  # Add logic to react to specific exceptions
                  ...
              finally:
                  # Add logic that should be executed even if stage fails
                  ...

    .. important::

        When implementing a task hook, make sure that ``StopAsyncIteration``
        exception is not absorbed. Otherwise, if `pipe` is given an async generator
        the pipeline might run forever.

                  ...
              except StopAsyncIteration:
                  # When passing async generator to `pipe`, StopAsyncIteration is raised
                  # from inside and will be caught here.
                  # Do no absort it and propagate it to the other.
                  # Usually, you do not want to do anything here.
