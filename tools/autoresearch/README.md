# Autoresearch: Automated SPDL Pipeline Optimization

Automated experiment engine for optimizing SPDL data loading pipeline performance in AI training jobs. Uses a coding agent to analyze metrics, identify bottlenecks, propose parameter and code changes, and iterate to minimize steady-state step time.

```

Each coding-agent invocation is **stateless**. The engine carries all state and assembles self-contained prompts from:
- `prompts/knowledge/` — compiled SPDL optimization knowledge
- Experiment state — master table, history, previous analyses
- Fetched metrics — system metrics, pipeline performance stats

## Design Choices

Autoresearch is built around a small runner and explicit persisted state. The runner only schedules coroutine work and checkpoints what is queued or running; the workflow owns experiment semantics such as applying code changes, launching jobs, analyzing results, and proposing follow-ups.

This keeps runs inspectable and resumable. Coding-agent calls are stateless, deterministic workflow decisions are separated into testable helpers, and `engine/checkpoint.json` is the source of truth for recovery after interruption.

The implementation is unusual in one important way: platform behavior is grouped behind explicit capability objects instead of injected as a flat callback bag. `AutoresearchPlatform` owns `workspace`, `artifacts`, `execution`, `evidence`, and `agent`, so the same workflow can run locally, through a remote executor, or with different coding agents without changing the runner.

## Architecture

```
spdl autoresearch / launch.sh
  │ launches Claude or Codex as interactive supervisor
  ▼
Supervisor agent
  │ gathers config from user, starts engine, monitors progress
  ▼
run.py ──► runner.py (generic async scheduler)
  │              │
  │  adapter     │  manages: priority queue, concurrent coroutine slots,
  │              │  checkpointing, and cancellation persistence
  ▼              │
workflow/      ▼
adapter.py  asyncio.wait(FIRST_COMPLETED)
  │             → immediate analysis on completion
  │             → follow-up experiments returned as child WorkSpecs
  ├─ workflow/store.py       durable state + monitoring views
  ├─ workflow/policy.py      deterministic, testable decisions
  ├─ workflow/*_ops.py       source/build/analysis/planning operations
  └─ platform/               workspace/artifacts/execution/evidence/agent
```

**Execution model:**

1. **Public CLI** (`spdl autoresearch`, or `launch.sh` in this source tree) — always interactive. The selected supervisor agent gathers missing config, starts the engine, monitors progress, and intervenes on errors.
2. **Engine command** (`run.py`) — non-interactive implementation detail. The supervisor invokes it with complete config, and tests can call it directly.

### Engine Design

The runner (`core/_orchestrator.py`) is generic and domain-agnostic. It knows nothing about SPDL, coding agents, source control, local subprocesses, training jobs, metrics, or hypothesis planning. It only runs serializable `WorkSpec` objects as coroutines, checkpoints queued/running work, and persists an `interrupted` checkpoint when cancellation reaches the process.

Autoresearch behavior belongs in the workflow side of the boundary:

- `utils/workflow/adapter.py` orchestrates each experiment lifecycle: prepare source, build, launch, poll, analyze, update state, and return child `WorkSpec` objects.
- `utils/workflow/store.py` owns durable workdir files such as `engine/checkpoint.json`, `tree.json`, per-node status, and monitoring views.
- `utils/workflow/policy.py` owns deterministic decisions such as status normalization, duplicate filtering, planning gates, and stall policy. Keep predictable logic here so it can be unit-tested without a coding agent or infrastructure.
- `utils/platform/` owns swappable capabilities for workspace, artifacts, execution, evidence collection, and coding-agent calls.

Each experiment node runs as an independent `asyncio.Task` through prepare → launch → poll → analyze. The runner uses `asyncio.wait(return_when=FIRST_COMPLETED)` so whichever job finishes first is immediately analyzed and its follow-ups are enqueued.

Key features:
- **Configurable concurrency** — up to N jobs run simultaneously
- **Tree-structured hypotheses** — experiments branch from parent commits, enabling exploration of multiple optimization paths
- **Wall-clock stuck detection** — jobs exceeding `job_timeout_s` are killed immediately (no stall-counting delay)
- **Serialized state mutation** — workflow state updates are guarded so concurrent completions do not corrupt shared state
- **Graceful shutdown** — SIGINT persists queued and running specs to disk; re-running resumes from where it left off

### Engine Disk Layout

All state is persisted to `{workdir}/engine/` for crash recovery and external observability:

```
engine/
├── checkpoint.json        # Serialized queued/running WorkSpecs; resume source of truth
├── engine_state.json     # {status, timestamp, node counts}
├── tree.json             # Full hypothesis tree
├── queue.json            # Priority-ordered pending node IDs (monitoring view)
├── active.json           # Currently running jobs (monitoring view)
└── nodes/                # Per-node directories
    ├── 000_baseline/
    │   ├── spec.json     # Experiment specification
    │   ├── status.txt    # queued|preparing|running|analyzing|completed|failed
    │   └── result.json   # Analysis result (after completion)
    └── ...
```

### Live Progress

After each completed experiment, the engine updates:
- `summary.md` — current metrics, recent results
- `progress.png` — Karpathy-style progress chart (duration, step time, SM util)
- `hypothesis_tree.png` — tree visualization showing how experiments branch and evolve

### Stop and Resume

Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the engine gracefully. The runner persists queued and running `WorkSpec` objects to `engine/checkpoint.json` before exiting, and the workflow keeps the monitoring views under `engine/` up to date. Running jobs on the cluster continue independently.

Re-run the same command to resume — the engine re-checks job status and picks up where it left off.

## Buck Binary Targets

Two binaries are provided:

- `:autoresearch` — bare framework binary. Eventually accepts an arbitrary user-supplied workflow via `--workflow module.path:factory`. Today it falls back to the bundled pipeline-optimization workflow when `--workflow` is not supplied, so the legacy invocations under `examples/*/fb/autoresearch.sh` continue to work.
- `:autoresearch_with_pipeline_opt` — convenience binary that bundles the pipeline-optimization workflow alongside the framework. The default if you want the out-of-the-box SPDL pipeline-optimization behavior at Meta.

When the entry point eventually merges into the unified `spdl` CLI, the framework dispatcher allows the workflow implementation to evolve (or be supplied by the user) without rebuilding the CLI binary.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Supervised CLI

```bash
./launch.sh
```

The CLI starts Claude or Codex as a supervisor. The supervisor asks for your
pipeline script, build command, launch command, etc., then starts and monitors
the engine.

For a pre-configured use case:
```bash
./launch.sh /tmp/my_experiment \
  --agent claude \
  --pipeline-script path/to/pipeline.py \
  --source-dir path/to/source \
  --build-command "docker build -t my_image ." \
  --base-launch-command "torchx run -s local entry.py:main --image \$IMAGE --num_workers 8"
```

### Option 2: Engine Command

```bash
# First run — provide all config
python run.py /tmp/my_experiment \
  --pipeline-script path/to/pipeline.py \
  --source-dir path/to/source \
  --build-command "docker build -t my_image ." \
  --base-launch-command "torchx run -s local entry.py:main --image \$IMAGE --num_workers 8" \
  --notes "Description of the experiment" \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --max-iterations 10 \
  --patience 3 \
  --max-concurrency 3 \
  --job-timeout 1800

# Resume after Ctrl+C (config is persisted)
python run.py /tmp/my_experiment

# Check progress (read these files in the workdir)
#   summary.md          — live progress summary
#   progress.png        — Karpathy-style progress chart
#   engine/engine_state.json — engine status + counts
#   engine/tree.json    — full hypothesis tree

# Generate final report
python cmd.py report /tmp/my_experiment
```

| `--patience` | Stop after N non-improving planning sessions | 3 |
| `--max-concurrency` | Maximum concurrent training jobs | 3 |
| `--job-timeout` | Wall-clock timeout per job in seconds | 1800 |
| `--poll-interval` | Seconds between job status polls | 120 |
| `--platform` | Execution platform: `auto`, `remote`, or `local` | auto |
| `--agent` | Coding agent: `claude` or `codex` | claude |
| `--local-execution-mode` | Local launch mode: `full`, `dataloader_only`, or `dry_run` | full |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | Skip Claude permission prompts | off |
| `--skip-instrument` | Skip TTFB/step-time auto-instrumentation | off |

## What Gets Optimized

The primary objective is to **minimize steady-state step time** — the median step time after discarding warmup steps. This directly predicts production training throughput.

### Metric Hierarchy

1. **Steady-state step time** (`steady_step_time_ms`) — most reliable. Median step time after warmup (first ~20 steps).
2. **Steady-state SM utilization** (`steady_sm_utilization_pct`) — proxy when step time is unavailable. Uses p50/p75 from system metrics (not the raw average, which is diluted by initialization).
3. **Raw job duration** — least reliable for short experiments due to variable init times.

Raw average SM utilization is **not used** for optimization — it's heavily affected by the zero-utilization initialization phase in short experiments.

### Tracked Metrics

- **Step time** — duration of one training iteration
- **SM Utilization** — GPU streaming multiprocessor activity (steady-state p50/p75)
- **TTFB** — time to first batch
- **Data readiness** — fraction of time the sink queue has data available
- **CPU utilization** — must stay ≤40% to avoid noisy-neighbor effects
- **Job duration** — total wall clock time

Typical optimizations include MTP (subprocess pipeline), concurrency tuning, batch size tuning, `torch.compile`, stage splitting, and GC management.

### Stopping Criteria

The engine stops when **both** conditions are met:

1. **All best practices tried** — baseline, headspace (CacheDataLoader), MTP (subprocess pipeline), batch size tuning, and concurrency tuning must each be attempted.

2. **Plateau detected** — steady-state metrics have not improved for `--patience` consecutive planning sessions.

An "iteration" counts each time the coding agent is asked to plan, not each completed job. With `--max-iterations 40`, the engine runs up to 40 planning sessions, each producing 2-3 experiments.

## Source Control Integration

When `--source-dir` is provided, autoresearch integrates with source control (`sl` or `git`, auto-detected):

- **Anchor commit** recorded at init — the system never reverts beyond this point
- **Code changes are committed** automatically with descriptive messages prefixed `[autoresearch]`
- **Tree-structured commits** — experiments branch from parent commits, enabling multiple optimization paths. When the coding agent specifies `revert_to`, the engine goes to that commit before applying new changes.
- **Instrumentation commit** — TTFB/step-time logging is committed separately during init

## Agent Decision Framework

In each planning session, the coding agent chooses one of three actions:

| Action | When | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| `launch` | Parameter or code changes to test | Engine applies changes, builds, launches, monitors, analyzes |
| `manual` | Change requires human judgment | Engine pauses; user intervenes |
| `stop` | Metrics plateaued AND all best practices tried | Engine finishes |

### Headspace Analysis

The engine automatically launches a **headspace job** that wraps the data pipeline with `spdl.dataloader.CacheDataLoader`. This measures the upper bound of improvement from data loading optimization. The headspace percentage tells you how much of the training step is data loading overhead — if headspace is low, further pipeline optimization won't help much.

Headspace results are excluded from the running best and plateau detection.

## Customization

- **`config.json`**: edit agent-specific flags to pass additional CLI options
- **`prompts/`**: edit templates to adjust agent behavior or add domain-specific knowledge
- **`prompts/knowledge/`**: add project-specific optimization context
- **`prompts/platform/`**: add execution-environment guidance
- **`prompts/supervisor/`**: add top-level supervisor guidance
